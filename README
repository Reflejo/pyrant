Pyrant
======

Pyrant is a Python wrapper around Tokyo Tyrant. It provides:

* TyrantProtocol: a thin API for the Tyrant protocol with support for table
  database;
* Tyrant: a higher-level dict-like API;
* Query: a high-level API for complex queries (inspired by Django ORM). 

Documentation
-------------

See complete `HTML documentation <http://packages.python.org/pyrant/>`_
for details. Sometimes it may get slightly outdated. You can always have the
latest snapsnot by building it from the source (using Sphinx).

What is Tokyo Tyrant?
---------------------

Tokyo Tyrant is a network interface for Tokyo Cabinet.

Tokyo Cabinet is a lightweight database manager with several storages,
including a simple key/value storage and a document-oriented schemaless
database with powerful query machinery.

Models (schemata)
-----------------

Pyrant does not provide means for defining models, but another project called
`Models`[1] allows to do that easily.
