History notes
-------------

The lists above are incomplete because it is difficult to track all
contributions to PyTyrant and derivative works due to the nature of their
development process. Some people submitted bug tickets and patches to
PyTyrant[1] which was meanwhile forked to support tables. (We refer to that fork
as "PyTableTyrant" because it introduced a class of the same name though
retained the project name PyTyrant.) The latter fork spawned a cloud of its own
forks[2] that were never completely synchronized. Even the PyTableTyrant was
not merged back into PyTyrant. Pyrant, in turn, was a rewrite[3] which included
ideas and some pieces of code from the above-mentioned projects but did not
inherit their commit history so it is hard to tell on which revision it was
primarily based and whose ideas and patches influenced its progress.

Please refer to the revision logs and the bug trackers of the original projects
to gather complete information on contributions.
